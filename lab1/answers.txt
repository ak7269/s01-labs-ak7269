Answer to Exercise 7: do while loops execute once initially and then checks the while condition. Due to this, the do while loop here is accessing an empty linked list and saying that the size of the linked list is 1 even though it is 0. Therefore I changed the do while loop to a while loop so that it checks the condition and does not enter the loop if it is an empty linked list.
