Answers to exercises G1--G3:

G1:

This command grep -r "smutex" prints the lines that contains "smutex_t".
Binary file build/sthread.o matches
Binary file build/estoresim matches
sthread.h:typedef pthread_mutex_t smutex_t;
sthread.h:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex);
sthread.h:void smutex_destroy(smutex_t *mutex);
sthread.h:void smutex_lock(smutex_t *mutex);
sthread.h:void smutex_unlock(smutex_t *mutex);

G2:

grep "Task" RequestGenerator.cpp
This command above could be used to search the file RequestGenerator.cpp for Task objects.
grep "return" .h
This command above could be used to search all header files for the keyword return.

G3:

This command returns lines that have smutex with only one parameter which are the lock, unlock, destroy and init functions. This command gives us the functions' header that follows the syntax provided in the command, here it gives the method header with only one parameter.
